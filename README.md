##Programs

This assignment required the creation of one program which lived inside ctest.c.

###ctest.c

To run ctest, simply compile the project and run the following in the project directory. A sample of output is also included below.

    user@computer:~/cs2303assig3$ ./ctest
    Pointers: a1 = 0x7fff5aff3b80, a2 = 0x7fff5aff3b16, a3 = 0x7fff5aff3b60
              p1 = 0x104c0dc80 p2 = 0x10
    a1 = Hi
    a2 = Hello
    a3 = Hello, also
    a1 = HiHello
    a1 = HiHelloHello
    a1 = HiHelloHelloHello, a
    Before dup, pointer a2 = 0x7fff5aff3b16, contents = Hello
    Pointer p2 = 0x7ff1fac00080, contents = Hello
    
    Testing mystrcat and mystrncat
    a4 = Testing mystrcpyHell
    
    Testing mystrncpy and mystrndup
    a5 (too long to fit) = This is a long strin√ø
    a5 = This is a long
    p3 (copy of a5, truncated to 4 chars) = This
